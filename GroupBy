-- Basic table data
select * from order_details;

-- Selecting multiple columns without GROUP BY
select customer_id, product_id from order_details;

-- GROUP BY on single column
select customer_id 
from order_details 
group by customer_id;

-- DISTINCT gives the same output as GROUP BY (for single column)
select distinct customer_id from order_details;

-- ❌ This may cause ERROR in MySQL (ONLY_FULL_GROUP_BY mode)
select customer_id, product_id 
from order_details 
group by customer_id;

-- ✔️ Correct way when using GROUP BY on multiple columns
select customer_id, product_id
from order_details
group by customer_id, product_id;

-------------------------------------------------------------
-- 🛑 ERROR NOTE
-- Error Code: 1055
-- Expression of SELECT list is not in GROUP BY clause
-- and contains non-aggregated column
-- This happens because MySQL is in ONLY_FULL_GROUP_BY mode
-------------------------------------------------------------

-- ✅ Simple explanation of the error:

-- When ONLY_FULL_GROUP_BY is ON:
-- Every column in SELECT must be:
--  1) present in GROUP BY
--      OR
--  2) used inside an aggregate function
--     like COUNT(), SUM(), MIN(), MAX(), AVG()
